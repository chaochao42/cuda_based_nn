# Build CUDA Neural Network expanded



## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **CUDA**: Ensure that you have CUDA installed on your system. You can download it from [NVIDIA's website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
- **Make**: Required for building the project.
- **A modern C++ compiler**: GCC or Clang is recommended.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:chaochao42/cuda_based_nn.git
   cd BuildCudaNeuralNetworkFromScratch
   ```

2. Build the project using Make:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   ./cuda-conv
   ```
